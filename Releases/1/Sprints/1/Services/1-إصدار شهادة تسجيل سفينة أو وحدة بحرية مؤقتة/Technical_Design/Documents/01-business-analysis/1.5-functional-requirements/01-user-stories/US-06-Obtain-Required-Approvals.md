# US-06 – Obtain Required External Approvals

As an Applicant
I want required approvals (e.g., MAFWR for fishing vessels) to be obtained through the system
So that I do not have to complete manual approval steps.

## Notes
- Conditional approval based on vessel category/activity.
- Traceability anchor: SP05.
