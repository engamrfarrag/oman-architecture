# US-07 – Complete Vessel Inspection When Required

As an Applicant
I want the system to arrange and track vessel inspection when required
So that I can proceed only when compliance is confirmed.

## Notes
- Conditional based on construction phase, length threshold, vessel category (e.g., tug boat), and other policy conditions.
- Traceability anchor: SP06.
